I graduated with a Ph.D. in Analytical Chemistry from Bo Zhang's Lab at the University of Washington, Seattle in August 2021. Here, I contributed to 10 peer-reviewed publications in the fields of nanoscience, electrochemistry, optical microscopy, and material science (with my most-recent being a first-author publication in JACS). 

Over the COVID lockdowns (starting March 2020) I taught myself to code in Python, and built multiple data analysis pipelines for my research, saving well over 1,000 hours in tedious manual analysis. 

I have posted the code and descriptions for some of these projects here in the "Portfolio" Tab. 
These include: 
- [Spatially Mapping Redox Activity from Microelectrode Arrays](https://peterdefnet.github.io/portfolio/portfolio-2/)
- [Characterizing Nanoparticle Arrays with Computer Vision Methods](https://peterdefnet.github.io/portfolio/portfolio-1/)
